12/Flux Security Architecture
=============================

This document describes the mechanisms used to secure Flux instances
against unauthorized access and prevent privilege escalation and other

== Overview

Flux is distributed software that runs parallel programs on behalf of
users in a multi-user Linux environment, including but not limited to
commodity HPC Linux clusters.   Flux is unique among resource managers
in that a Flux instance may be launched as a parallel program by an
unprivileged user.

Flux runs in single and multi-user mode.  A single-user Flux instance
only launches work as the instance owner.  A multi-user Flux instance
launches work as other users.

The bootstrap instance of Flux runs as a system service started by
systemd(8) or equivalent and runs in multi-user mode.  Other instances
may run in single or multi-user mode, and may be launched by Flux,
another resource manager, or with a standalone launcher.

== Implementation

This early draft is mainly focused on single-user, non-bootstrap
Flux instances.

=== Instance Owner ===

The Flux broker processes comprising a Flux instance SHALL run
as a common user ID termed the "instance owner".  The instance owner
SHALL have control over the instance and its resources; however,
the instance owner SHALL NOT have the capability to launch work as
other users without their consent.

A bootstrap instance MAY run as a dedicated user, such as "flux".

The instance owner SHALL NOT be the root user.

=== Overlay Networks ===

Users other than the instance owner SHALL NOT be permitted to connect
to an instance's overlay networks.  Since overlay networks are implemented
using the ZeroMQ messaging library, these connections SHALL be secured
using a configurable ZeroMQ security plugin other than "NONE".
ZeroMQ security is documented in:

* http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23[ZeroMQ RFC 23 ZMTP ZeroMQ Message Transport Protocol]
* http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:24[ZeroMQ RFC 24 ZMTP PLAIN]
* http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:25[ZeroMQ RFC 25 ZMTP CURVE]
* http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:26[ZeroMQ RFC 26 CurveZMQ]
* http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:27[ZeroMQ RFC 27 ZAP ZeroMQ Authentication Protocol]
* http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:38[ZeroMQ RFC 38 ZMTP GSSAPI]

The default ZeroMQ security plugin SHALL be "CURVE", which provides
message privacy, authenticity, and integrity with low overhead.
The long-term CURVE keys of the instance owner are loaded from the
file system at instance startup (by default, from their home directory).
Long term CURVE keys SHALL be encoded in ZeroMQ certificate format that
is documented in:

* http://hintjens.com/blog:53[Securing ZeroMQ: Soul of a New Certificate], P. Hintjens, October 2013.
* http://hintjens.com/blog:62[ZeroMQ Certificates, Design Iteration 1], P. Hintjens, October 2013.

A long-term CURVE certificate SHALL NOT be used if it is damaged, or if
file system permissions allow the private key portion to be read by other
users.  If certificates are stored in a network file system, it is strongly
RECOMMENDED that network file system traffic be protected from eavesdropping.

The optional EPGM multicast overlay for Flux events cannot at present be
secured using ZeroMQ security plugins; therefore, it SHALL be secured by
encapsulating each message in a MUNGE credential encoded as the instance
owner with the MUNGE_OPT_UID_RESTRICTION flag set to prevent unauthorized
access.  MUNGE comes with the presumption of pre-shared MUNGE keys and
numerical user id synchronization over participating hosts.  If MUNGE is
unavailable within these constraints, the optional EPGM overlay network
SHALL NOT be enabled.

=== Direct Broker Connection

The Flux API provides the +flux_open()+ function which connects
directly to the Flux broker, then permits unrestricted use of Flux
instance services over that connection.  Users other than the instance
owner SHALL NOT be permitted to directly connect to the Flux broker.
Direct broker connections that traverse physical networks SHALL implement
authenticity, privacy, and integrity.

+flux_open()+ uses "connectors" to implement different connection mechanisms.
The broker side of a connector implementation SHALL provide appropriate
security, depending on the implementation:

The *local* connector only permits connection via PF_LOCAL socket.
Users SHALL be authenticated using the SO_PEERCRED socket option, or
equivalent.  Privacy and integrity are unnecessary in this context.

The *ssh* connector permits connection over untrusted networks.
Its spawns a remote process using SSH protocol, which implements
privacy, security, and integrity.  The remote process connects to the
broker using any of the available connectors.  The *ssh* connector
has no broker side implementation and therefore adds no new ingress
points to the broker to be secured.  Its security relies on proper
configuration of SSH, therefore it is RECOMMENDED that best practices be
followed when configuring up SSH.

The *shmem* connector only permits connection via ZeroMQ "inproc"
sockets from comms modules loaded by the broker and spawned as threads.
No security is required in this context.

The *loop* connector is used only for testing and doesn't connect
to the broker.  No security is required in this context.

=== Process Management Interface (PMI)

Programs launched by a Flux instance MAY use PMI services,
a quasi-standard set of APIs and wire protocols, to obtain program
attributes, exchange endpoint information, and to spawn additional tasks.
Programs use PMI in one of three methods:

1. Programs link against a shared library provided by the resource
manager, which provides well known PMI API calls.
2. Programs are given a connection to the resource manager by passing
an inherited file descriptor, whose number is communicated with an
environment variable.  Programs then use a well known PMI wire protocol
to communicate with the resource manager.
3. programs and resource managers link against a shared library provided
by a standalone PMI implementation, which implements both a well known PMI
API and a resource manager API.  The PMI implementation manages connections
between programs and resource managers.

In a multi-user instance, PMI service as in (1) SHALL be provided by
a shared library that implements PMI API in terms of its wire protocol,
and proceeds as in (2).

In a single-user instance, PMI service as in (1) MAY be provided by
a shared library that implements PMI API directly in terms of Flux
services, as a stop-gap measure while multi-user PMI is under development.
Security is as described for direct broker connections.

PMI service as in (2) SHALL be provided by a purpose-built Flux service
that implements a handler for PMI wire protocol and pre-connects programs
using file descriptor passing.  No security is required in this context.
This PMI service SHALL NOT expose Flux services directly to programs;
for example, the PMI KVS calls SHALL NOT be allowed full access to the
Flux KVS namespace.

PMI service as in (3) requires auditing of the standalone PMI implementation
to ensure that connections are properly secured, and access to Flux services
is limited as in (2).  (This is the "preferred" PMIx model - viability TBD).

=== Other Program Services

TBD: Tool interfaces, grow/shrink.

=== External Services

TBD: Users other than instance owner ability to list queue, submit work,
kill their jobs, retrieve I/O, check status, etc..  A web service started
by instance's initial program?  ACL?

=== Resource Containment

Programs launched by an instance SHALL be contained within their resource
allotment.

TBD: Unprivileged instance needs to call unshare(2), which requires
CAP_SYS_ADMIN, etc.

TBD: Containment should be implemented as a stack of plugins that execute
at different points in the life cycle of a program.

=== Multi-user Considerations

TBD: Unprivileged instance needs to call seteuid(2), which requires
CAP_SET_UID, etc.

TBD: Unprivileged instance SHALL NOT be able to launch processes
as a user other than the instance owner without approval of that user.
(The instance owner "owns" the resources allocated to the instance;
the user "owns" their identity)

=== Integration with OS Security Software

As a general rule Flux, and the packages it depends on, SHOULD link against
packaged, shared library versions of security significant software provided
by the OS distribution.  This allows Flux to receive timely fixes for
security vulnerabilities, without requiring Flux to be rebuilt.
These include:

* libzmq.so, libczmq.so
* libsodium.so (libzmq should avoid configuring built in "tweetnacl" alternative)
* libgssapi_krb5.so, libkrb5.so, libk5crypto.so, etc..

TBD: integration MAY be required with:

* SELinux
* Linux pluggable authentication modules (PAM)
* Linux cgroups
* Linux private namespaces (unshare(2))
* systemd
* SSH

=== Integration with site services

TBD: integration MAY be required with:

* Kerberos V
* LDAP
* file systems
