== Goals

Flux components can be extended using dynamic shared object modules.
The goals of the Flux Module Extension Protocol are:

* Define service-neutral message protocol
* Facilitate reuse of module management utility by multiple services.
* Modules should self-identify by defining a name symbol
* Module name should indicate what service/component the module extends.
* Define mechanism to pass arguments to modules at insertion time.

== Introduction ==

In this description, "base component" is used to describe any Flux
component that is being extended with modules, and "extension module"
is used to describe the extension.  A Flux component may have both
roles; For example, comms modules, introduced in RFC 3, are extension
modules that extend the Flux broker base component.  When a comms
module _itself_ has extension modules, it is also a base component.
The design places no limit on the depth of the extension hierarchy;
that is, extension modules can have extension modules which can have
extension modules, etc..

Extension modules may be implemented as "messaging actors", which
execute in their own thread and communicate with the base component
exclusively with messages, or as "plugins" that provide a set of
well known function entry points that are called from the base
component's thread of control.  Both types of extension module define
common symbols and can be loaded/unloaded/listed with common management
messages and user tools, thus reducing duplication of effort across Flux
components.  A base component may support one or both types, according
to its requirements.

Extension modules are assigned names that indicate their position
the extension hierarchy.   An extension module with a single word
name like "foo" is a comms module;  its module extension names have
"foo." as a prefix, e.g. "foo.bar";  _its_ module extension names
of "foo.bar." as a prefix, e.g. "foo.bar.baz; etc..

Base components with extension modules must handle requests to load,
unload, and list their extension modules.  For example, a comms module
named "foo" would implement request handlers for "foo.insmod", "foo.rmmod",
and "foo.lsmod".  This allows a single tool to be used to manage
extension modules for all Flux components that have them.

Base components that are extended by messaging actor based extension
modules should provide message routing services to their extension modules.
For example, a request to "foo.bar.ping" would be delivered to "foo",
which should have registered a request handler for "foo.bar.*".  That
request should be routed by "foo" to "bar", which would send a ping
response message back through the same routes taken by the request.

Plugin style extension modules have no communications path to the base
component and no thread of control, so they cannot have managed extension
modules without a proxy arrangement with the base component.


== Implementation

=== Extension Module Symbols

A Flux extension module SHALL export the following global symbols:

+const char *mod_name;+::
A null-terminated C string defining the module name.
The module name SHALL be structured as set of component names
delimited by periods.

+int mod_main (void *context, int argc, char **argv);+::
A C function that SHALL either be the entry point for a thread
of control, or an initialization function.  This function SHALL
return zero to indicate success or -1 to indicate failure.
The POSIX `errno` thread-specific variable should be set to indicate the
type of error on failure.

A Flux extension module MAY export the following global symbols:

+const char *service_name;+::
A null-terminated C string defining the service name provided by the
module, if different from the module name.

A base component MAY call +dlopen()+ with _RTLD_LOCAL_ flag,
then access these symbols with +dlsym()+.

=== Loading an Extension Module ===

A base component SHALL load an extension module either as a
messaging actor or a plugin.

A messaging actor style extension module SHALL be launched in its own
thread or process with a communications socket connected to its base component.
In the new thread or process, +mod_main()+ SHALL be called with optional
arguments and a handle representing the communications socket.  When
+mod_main()+ returns, the module thread or process SHALL exit.
While the module thread or process is executing, the base component provides
message routing services on its behalf.

A plugin style extension module's  +mod_main()+ SHALL be called as an
initialization function in the base component's thread of control.
The base component MAY use +dlsym()+ to access service-specific methods.

=== Monitoring an Extension Module ===

A messaging actor style extension module SHALL send RFC 3 keepalive messages
containing status integers to the base component over its communications
socket.  Status integers are enumerated as follows:

* FLUX_MODSTATE_INIT (0) - initializing

* FLUX_MODSTATE_SLEEPING (1) - sleeping

* FLUX_MODSTATE_RUNNING (2) - running

* FLUX_MODSTATE_FINALIZING (3) - finalizing

* FLUX_MODSTATE_EXITED (4) - `mod_main()` exited

Keepalive messages SHALL be sent to the base component on each state transition.
In addition, keepalive message MAY be sent to the base component at regular
intervals.  The keepalive `errnum` field SHALL be zero except
when `mod_main()` returns a value of -1 indicating failure and state
transitions to FLUX_MODSTATE_EXITED.  In this case `errnum` SHALL be set
to the value of POSIX `errno` set by `mod_main()` before returning.

Base components MAY track the number of session heartbeats since an
extension module last sent a message to the base component and report
this as "idle time" for the extension module.

=== Unloading an Extension Module ===

A base component that supports dynamic unloading of messaging actor style
extension modules SHALL send a shutdown request to the extension module.
In response, the extension module SHALL exit `mod_main()`, send a
keepalive transition to FLUX_MODSTATE_EXITED state, and exit the
extension module's thread or process.  This final state transition indicates
to the base component that it MAY clean up the thread or process.

=== Module Management Message Definitions

Module management messages SHALL follow the CMB1 rules described
in RFC 3 for requests and responses with JSON payloads.

A base component supporting extension modules SHALL implement the _insmod_,
_rmmod_, and _lsmod_ methods.  A general utility supporting module
management SHALL dynamically construct message topic strings by
combining the service name with these methods as described in RFC 3.

The base component's `insmod` request handler SHALL wait until the
state transitions out of FLUX_MODSTATE_INIT before returning a response.
If it transitions immediately to FLUX_MODSTATE_EXITED, and the `errnum`
value is nonzero, an error response SHALL be returned as described in RFC 3.

Module management messages are described in detail by the following
ABNF grammar:

----
MODULE          = C:insmod-req S:insmod-rep
                / C:rmmod-req  S:rmmod-rep
                / C:lsmod-req  S:lsmod-rep

; Multi-part zeromq messages
C:insmod-req    = [routing] insmod-topic insmod-json PROTO ; see below for JSON
S:insmod-rep    = [routing] insmod-topic PROTO

C:rmmod-req     = [routing] rmmod-topic rmmod-json PROTO   ; see below for JSON
S:rmmod-rep     = [routing] rmmod-topic PROTO

C:lsmod-req     = [routing] lsmod-topic PROTO
S:lsmod-rep     = [routing] lsmod-topic lsmod-json PROTO   ; see below for JSON

; topic strings are optional service + module operation
insmod-topic    = [service] "insmod"
rmmod-topic     = [service] "rmmod"
lsmod-topic     = [service] "lsmod"
service         = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / ".") "."

; PROTO and [routing] are as defined in RFC 3.
