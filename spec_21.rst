Background
----------

The job state machine is intended to be a useful abstraction of job life
cycle for users. If a job is not yet running, the job state communicates
at a high level what it is waiting for. In addition to being available to
query, job states may also be used as a basis for synchronization by tools
such as workflow managers.

A job is said to be *active* if it has not yet reached the captive end state,
and *inactive* once it has.


Design Criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Job states SHOULD exist for job phases with the potential for long duration,
   to provide transparency to users.

-  The instance owner and job owner SHALL be permitted to monitor job state
   transitions, for synchronization.

-  There SHALL be one initial state and one final state.

-  All job state transitions SHALL be initiated by the job manager.

-  A state SHALL exist for synchronization on job completion, such that
   job data in the KVS is stable once this state is reached.

-  All job state transitions SHALL be driven by events.

-  Events SHALL be logged to the job eventlog.

-  Replaying the job eventlog SHALL accurately reproduce the current job state.


Implementation
--------------


State Diagram

|states|


State Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NEW
   Initial state. The required ``submit`` event, which logs the jobâ€™s creation,
   transitions the state to DEPEND.

DEPEND
   The job is blocked waiting for dependencies to be satisfied. Once all
   dependencies have been satisfied the ``depend`` event is logged and
   the state transitions to PRIORITY.

PRIORITY
   The job is blocked waiting for a priority to be assigned by the job
   manager priority plugin.  Upon priority assignment, the job manager logs the
   ``priority`` event.  The state transitions to SCHED.

SCHED
   The job is blocked waiting for resources. The job manager sends an
   allocation request to the scheduler and receives a response once the
   job has been assigned resources, then logs the ``alloc`` event.
   The state transitions to RUN.

RUN
   The job is able to run or is running. The job manager sends a request
   to the exec service to start the job, then logs a ``start`` event once the
   job shells have been started, and a ``finish`` event once all the job shells
   have exited. The state transitions to CLEANUP.

CLEANUP
   The job has completed or an exception has occurred. Under normal termination,
   the job manager waits for notification from the exec service that job
   resources can be released, logging ``release`` events, then returns resources
   to the scheduler and logs a ``free`` event. Under exceptional termination,
   one or more steps may be unnecessary, depending on prior events.
   Once cleanup is complete, the job manager logs a ``clean`` event.
   The state transitions to INACTIVE.

INACTIVE
   Job data in KVS is now read-only (captive state).


Virtual States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the interest of encouraging consistent language, we define the following
"virtual states" as shorthand for the union of two or more actual job states:

PENDING
  The job is in DEPEND, PRIORITY, or SCHED states.

RUNNING
  The job is in RUN or CLEANUP states.

ACTIVE
  The job is in DEPEND, PRIORITY, SCHED, RUN, or CLEANUP states.


Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~

An exception event is an extraordinary occurrence that MAY interrupt the
"normal" job life cycle.

An exception SHALL be assigned a severity value from 0 (most severe)
to 7 (least severe).

An exception event with severity of zero SHALL cause the job state to
immediately transition to ``CLEANUP``. Exception events with a severity
other than zero do not affect job state, and are assumed to be meaningful
to other components managing non-fatal exceptions.

More than one exception MAY occur per job.

The exception event format is described below.


Event Descriptions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Job state transitions are driven by events that are logged to
``job.<jobid>.eventlog`` as required by RFC 16.

Events are formatted as described in RFC 18, with additional requirements
described below:

Memo Event
^^^^^^^^^^

A brief data record has been associated with the job.

The context object SHALL be considered the data to associate with
the job.  Any data attached to the job via a previous "memo"
event SHALL be updated, i.e. existing keys SHALL be replaced.

Debug Event
^^^^^^^^^^^

Debug event names are prefixed with "debug." They are optional and
are intended to provide context in the eventlog that aids debugging.

There are no specific requirements for the event context.

Example:

.. code:: json

   {"timestamp":1552594649.848032,"name":"debug.free-request"}


Synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any state but ``NEW`` is valid for synchronization.

Once a given state has been signaled (with a KVS snapshot reference), the
following invariants hold with respect to the KVS job schema described in
RFC 16:

CLEANUP
   Either an exception has been logged to ``job.<jobid>.eventlog``,
   or a global status code from the application is available (TBD).

INACTIVE
   ``job.<jobid>`` contains the final snapshot of the job schema.
