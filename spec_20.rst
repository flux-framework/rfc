********
Overview
********

Flexible resource representation is important for some of the key
components of Flux.
Resource requests are part of Flux jobspec, described in RFC 14.
This RFC describes the format of a concrete resource-set representation
referred to as *R*, constructed by the scheduler in response
to a resource request.
*R* is input to the remote execution system, which uses information
expressed in *R* to establish containment, binding, mapping,
and execution of program tasks, apportioned across broker ranks.
As a program terminates, the execution system releases
shards of the original *R*, eventually
adding up to its union, back to the scheduler.
Finally, when a Flux instance launches a child instance,
*R* is passed down from the enclosing instance to the child instance,
where it primes the child scheduler with a block of allocatable resources.

************
Design Goals
************

*R* is designed with the following goals:

-  Identify the specific resources where a job's tasks are to be launched.

-  Identify the specific resources managed by a Flux instance.

-  Be suitable for inclusion in a job's post-mortem record, and useful for
   answering forensic questions like "did my job run on the node that failed?".

-  Handle nodes, cores, and GPUs simply to ease the initial Flux implementation.

-  Allow schedulers to add proprietary enhancements that are ignored by
   the rest of Flux.

-  Don't explode in size on large clusters/jobs.

-  Handle resource properties as described in RFC 31

-  Build towards the general resource model of RFC 4.



**************
Implementation
**************

Producers and Consumers
=======================

-  The scheduler for a Flux instance (or instance scheduler) uses
   this format to serialize each resource allocation
   as REQUIRED by the instance program execution service and OPTIONALLY
   REQUIRED by child scheduler instances.

-  The instance scheduler deserializes an *R* object to build
   its internal resource data used for scheduling.

-  Users MAY manually write an *R* object for testing and debugging.

-  User-facing utilities that query a resource status (e.g., what
   resources are available or idle, or what resources are allocated to a job)
   MAY use an *R* object to extract this information;

-  The program execution service emits a valid *R* object to release
   a resource subset of an *R* to the instance scheduler.

Resource Set Format Definition
==============================

The JSON documents that conform to the *R* format SHALL be referred
to as *R* JSON documents or in short *R* documents.
An *R* JSON document SHALL consist of a dictionary with four
keys: :data:`version`, :data:`execution`, :data:`scheduling` and
:data:`attributes`.  It SHALL be valid if and only
if it contains the :data:`version` key and either or both the :data:`execution`
and :data:`scheduling` keys. The value of the :data:`execution` key SHALL
contain sufficient data for the execution system to perform its core tasks. The
value of :data:`scheduling` SHALL contain sufficient data for schedulers.
Finally, the value of :data:`attributes` SHALL provide optional information
including but not being limited to data specific to the scheduler used to
create this JSON document.

.. data:: version

  The value of the :data:`version` key SHALL contain 1 to indicate
  the format version.

.. data:: execution

  The value of the :data:`execution` key SHALL contain at least the keys
  :data:`R_lite`, and :data:`nodelist`, with optional keys :data:`properties`,
  :data:`starttime` and :data:`expiration`. Other keys are reserved for future
  extensions.

  .. data:: R_lite

    :data:`R_lite` is a strict list of dictionaries each of which SHALL contain
    at least the :data:`rank` and :data:`children` keys.

    .. data:: rank

      The value of the :data:`rank` key SHALL be a string list of
      broker rank identifiers in **idset format** (See RFC 22). This list
      SHALL indicate the broker ranks to which other information in
      the current entry applies.

    .. data:: children

      The :data:`children` key encodes the information about certain compute
      resources contained within this compute node. The value of this key SHALL
      contain a dictionary with two keys: :data:`core` and :data:`gpu`. Other
      keys are reserved for future extensions.

      .. data:: core

        The :data:`core` key SHALL contain a logical compute core IDs string
        in RFC 22 **idset format**.

      .. data:: gpu

        The OPTIONAL :data:`gpu` key SHALL contain a logical GPU IDs string
        in RFC 22 **idset format**.

  .. data:: nodelist

    The :data:`nodelist` key SHALL be an array of hostnames which correspond to
    the :data:`rank` entries of the :data:`R_lite` dictionary, and serves as a
    mapping of :data:`R_lite` :data:`rank` entries to hostname. Each entry in
    :data:`nodelist` MAY contain a string in RFC 29 *Hostlist Format*, e.g.
    ``host[0-16]``.

  The :data:`execution` key MAY also contain any of the following optional keys:

  .. data:: properties

    The optional :data:`properties` key SHALL be a dictionary where each key
    maps a single property name to a RFC 22 idset string. The idset string SHALL
    represent a set of execution target ranks. A given execution target
    rank MAY appear in multiple property mappings. Property names SHALL
    be valid UTF-8, and MUST NOT contain the following illegal characters::

      ! & ' " ^ ` | ( )

    Additionally, the ``@`` character is reserved for scheduler specific
    property use. In this case, the literal property SHALL still apply
    to the defined execution target ranks, but the scheduler MAY use the
    suffix after ``@`` to apply the property to children resources of the
    execution target or for another scheduler specific purpose. For example,
    the property ``amd-mi50@gpu`` SHALL apply to the defined execution
    target ranks, but a scheduler MAY use the ``gpu`` suffix to perform
    scheduling optimization for gpus of the corresponding ranks. This MAY
    result in both ``amd-mi50@gpu`` and ``amd-mi50`` being valid properties
    for resources in the instance.

  .. data:: starttime

    The value of the :data:`starttime` key, if present, SHALL
    encode the start time at which the resource set is valid. The
    value SHALL be the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix Epoch
    (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) with optional microsecond precision.
    If :data:`starttime` is unset, then the resource set has no specified
    start time and is valid beginning at any time up to :data:`expiration`.

  .. data:: expiration

    The value of the :data:`expiration` key, if present, SHALL
    encode the end or expiration time of the resource set in seconds
    since the Unix Epoch, with optional microsecond precision. If
    :data:`starttime` is also set, :data:`expiration` MUST be greater than
    :data:`starttime`. If :data:`expiration` is unset, the resource set has no
    specified end time and is valid beginning at :data:`starttime` without
    expiration.

.. data:: scheduling

  The :data:`scheduling` key MAY contain scheduler-specific resource data.  It
  SHALL NOT be interpreted other Flux components.  When used, it SHALL ride
  along on the resource acquisition protocol (RFC 28) and resource allocation
  protocol (RFC 27) so that it may be included in static configuration,
  allocated to jobs, and passed down a Flux instance hierarchy.

.. data:: attributes

  The purpose of the :data:`attributes` key is to provide optional
  information on this *R* document. The :data:`attributes` key SHALL
  be a dictionary of one key: :data:`system`.

  Other keys are reserved for future extensions.

  .. data:: system

    Attributes in the :data:`system` dictionary provide additional system
    information that have affected the creation of this *R* document.
    All of the system attributes are optional.

    A common system attribute is:

    .. describe:: scheduler

      The value of the :data:`scheduler` key is a free-from dictionary that
      may provide the information specific to the scheduler used
      to produce this document. For example, a scheduler that
      manages multiple job queues may add ``queue=batch``
      to indicate that this resource set was allocated from within
      its ``batch`` queue.


Example R
=========

The following is an example of a version 1 resource specification.
The example below indicates a resource set with the ranks 19
through 22.  These ranks correspond to the nodes node186 through
node189.  Each of the nodes contains 48 cores (0-47) and 8 gpus (0-7).
The :data:`starttime` and :data:`expiration` indicate the resources were valid
for about 30 minutes on February 16, 2023.
