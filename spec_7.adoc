7/Flux Coding Style Guide
=========================

This specification presents the recommended standards when contributing C code to the Flux code base.

* Name: github.com/flux-framework/rfc/spec_7.adoc
* Editor: Don Lipari <lipari@llnl.gov>
* State: draft

== Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

== Related Standards

* https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

== Goals

* Encourage a uniform coding style in flux-framework projects
* Provide a document to reference when providing style feedback in project pull requests

== C Coding Style Recommendations

In general, Flux follows the "Kernighan & Ritchie coding style" with the following exceptions or examples:

1. indent with spaces, not tabs
2. one level of indentation is 4 spaces, not 8
3. Put a space between function names and the opening parenthesis (we don't know why we do this)
4. Don't leave trailing spaces (or tabs) after the last non-space character in the line
5. Limit your lines to 80 characters
6. Indent comments to the depth of the code they are describing
7. Put the return type on the same line as the function declaration
8. Declare pointers by putting the white space between the star and the type.  Example:
----
int *ptr;
----

Tools That Modify Code to Conform to C Coding Style
---------------------------------------------------

"indent -kr" will bring you 95% of the way towards conforming to the Flux coding style

Those using vi will automatically follow some of the Flux style based on the following at the end of each file:

----
/*
 * vi:tabstop=4 shiftwidth=4 expandtab
 */
----

In vim, use the following to highlight whitespace errors:

----
let c_space_errors = 1
----

In emacs, add this to your custom-set-variables defs to highlight whitespace errors:

----
'(show-trailing-whitespace t)
----

For astyle, the pertinent options would be:
----
--indent-coll-comments --style=stroustrup --indent-spaces=4
 --align-pointer=name --max-code-length=80 --convert-tabs
----
