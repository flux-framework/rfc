13/Simple Process Manager Interface v1
======================================

The MPI process manager interface (PMI) version 1 is a de-facto standard
API and wire protocol for communication between MPI runtimes and resource
managers.  It was added to the MPICH2 MPI-2 reference implementation in
late 2001, and has since been widely implemented, but was not officially
standardized by the MPI Forum and has been only lightly documented.
This RFC is an attempt to document PMI-1 to guide developers of resource
managers that must support current and legacy MPI implementations.

== Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

== Related Standards

== Goals

* Decrease coupling between process managers and MPI implementations by
clarifying their "contract" for communication.
* Document the PMI-1 application programming interface (API)
* Document the PMI-1 wire protocol
* Document compatibility issues between protocol versions.
* Decrease the amount of research required to implement a process manager.
* Identify which functions are optional, and under what circumstances.

== PMI Versions

This document covers PMI 1.1 with a few notes about backwards
compatibility with earlier versions.

The PMI version 2 API is disjoint from version 1.  The version 2
wire protocol builds on the same fundamental structures as version 1,
but includes incompatible operations.  Clients and servers negotiate
the highest mutually supported protocol version, including across major
protocol versions.  Apart from version negotiation and the common
fundamentals, PMI version 2 a different protocol and not covered here.

PMIx ("x" for exascale, from the OpenMPI community) is a separate effort
that provides compatible PMI version 1 and 2 APIs but uses an incompatible
wire protocol.  PMIx is not covered here.

PMIX ("X" for extension), is as set of extensions to PMI-2.  The PMIX
extensions are not covered here.

== Overview

PMI was designed as an interface between process managers and parallel
programs, including, but not limited to, MPI runtimes.  It has two main
parts, one part designed to assist with bootstrap activities that need
to take place inside 'MPI_Init()', and the other part designed to
support MPI-2's dynamic process management features, such as
'MPI_Comm_spawn()'.

A newly-launched MPI process needs to find out (minimally) its rank,
the total number of ranks in the program, and network addresses of
other ranks.  The rank and size can be trivially passed to the process
from the process manager via environment variables.  Network addresses
could be assigned by the process manager and passed in a similar way,
but that would require the process manager to have intimate knowledge of
interconnects and the MPI implementation's internal wire-up topologies.
To achieve a separation of concerns, the PMI designers wisely suggested
that the process manager only provide a generic mechanism for MPI
processes to exchange information.

This mechanism consists of a key value store (KVS).  What one process
puts into the KVS can be read out by another process, after appropriate
synchronization.  A simple collective barrier function provides this
synchronization.  Once all processes have reached the barrier, all
data has been written, and can be read once processes are released
from the barrier.

Programs may access PMI-1 services provided by a process manager using
the PMI-1 wire protocol; a shared library providing the PMI-1 API
implemented using the PMI-1 wire protocol; or less flexibly, a shared
library providing the PMI-1 API implemented using a proprietary protocol.

== Terminology

"Process manager" is the provider of PMI services. A resource manager
MAY operate in the role of process manager.

"Process group" is a parallel program, including but not limited to
MPI programs.  It is the user of PMI services.  In this document
"program" is used interchangeably with process group.

"process" is a UNIX process, in this context, a member of a process
group or a program.

"PMI library" is a shared library that provides the PMI-1 API.

== Caveats

Some deficiencies of PMI 1 are noted in the PMI-2 paper[6]:

* There is no mechanism to scope a key locally for a subset of processes.
* PMI-1 is not thread safe.  On a given PMI connection, only one request
can be in flight concurrently.
* There is no way for a program to access the PMI KVS of another cooperating
program.
* There is no mechanism for respawning processes when a fault occurs.

In addition, the lack of strong guidance from the MPI Forum has limited
acceptance of the PMI wire protocol and resulted in incomplete and
non-conforming PMI library implementations.  This in turn has resulted
in stronger coupling between process managers and MPI implementations
than necessary.

== Environment

The process manager MAY use the UNIX environment to communicate basic
process group information to processes.

If the PMI wire protocol is offered, the process manager SHALL
set the following environment variables:

* PMI_FD - file descriptor process SHALL use to communicate with
process manager
* PMI_RANK - rank of this process within the program (zero-origin)
* PMI_SIZE - size of the program (number of ranks)
* PMI_SPAWNED - only set (to 1) if the program was created by
'PMI_Spawn_multiple()'

== Application Programming Interface

Programs SHOULD NOT strongly bind to a particular process manager's
PMI library, for example with rpath, as this complicates running a
compiled program under multiple process managers, especially if a
system includes process managers that use proprietary protocols.

To provide maximum interoperability, a PMI library SHOULD

* implement the PMI-1 wire protocol
* be named "libpmi"
* have a shared library major version number of 0
* provide all function signatures defined below

Functions tagged as "OPTIONAL" SHOULD be defined, but may be implemented
to return PMI_FAIL with no effect.

There is no defined mechanism to extend PMI-1 without inadvertently
coupling users of a extension to a PMI library and/or process manager,
therefore PMI libraries SHALL NOT implement functions not defined below.

=== Return Codes

All PMI-1 functions SHALL return one of the following integer values,
indicating the result of the operation:

* PMI_SUCCESS (0): operation completed successfully
* PMI_FAIL (-1): operation failed
* PMI_ERR_INIT (1): PMI not initialized
* PMI_ERR_NOMEM (2): input buffer not large enough

since the last 'PMI_KVS_Commit()' shall be stored into the specified
'kvsname'.

Errors:

* PMI_ERR_INVALID_ARG - invalid argument
* PMI_FAIL - commit failed

Notes:

* This function commits all previous puts since the last 'PMI_KVS_Commit()'
into the specified keyval space.
* It is a process local operation, thus in some implementations,
it MAY have no effect and still return PMI_SUCCESS.

[source,c]

be no shorter than the length returned by 'PMI_KVS_Get_value_length_max()'.
The user SHALL set 'key' to a NULL terminated string no longer (with NULL)
than the size returned by 'PMI_KVS_Get_key_length_max()'.

Upon success, the PMI library SHALL fill 'value' with the value of 'key'.

Errors:

* 'PMI_ERR_INVALID_KVS' - invalid kvsname argument
* 'PMI_ERR_INVALID_KEY' - invalid key argument

string representing the keyval space.

Errors:

* 'PMI_ERR_INVALID_ARG' - invalid argument
* 'PMI_ERR_INVALID_LENGTH' - invalid length argument
* 'PMI_FAIL' - unable to return the kvsname

Notes:

* length SHALL be greater than or equal to the length returned
by 'PMI_KVS_Get_name_length_max()'.
* 'PMI_Get_kvs_domain_id()' and 'PMI_Get_id()' SHALL be considered
an alias for 'PMI_KVS_Get_my_name()'.

[source,c]
----
int PMI_Barrier (void);
----
This function is a collective call across all processes in the process group
the local process belongs to.  The PMI library SHALL attempt to block until
all processes in the process group have entered the barrier call, or an
error occurs.

Errors:

* PMI_FAIL - barrier failed

Notes:

* This operation is the only collective defined for PMI-1.
* Some implementations MAY piggyback a KVS data exchange on the barrier
operation internally.
* The barrier operation MUST be usable as a generic synchronization mechanism,
without requiring KVS data to be queued for exchange.

                        int errors[]);
----
This function spawns a set of processes into a new process group.
'count' refers to the size of the array parameters 'cmd', 'argvs',
'maxprocs', 'info_keyval_sizes' and 'info_keyval_vectors'.
'preput_keyval_size' refers to the size of the 'preput_keyval_vector' array.

'preput_keyval_vector' contains keyval pairs that will be put in the
keyval space of the newly created process group before the processes
are started.

The 'maxprocs' array specifies the desired number of processes
to create for each 'cmd' string.  The actual number of processes
may be less than the numbers specified in maxprocs.  The acceptable
number of processes spawned may be controlled by ``soft'' keyvals in
the info arrays.

Environment variables may be passed to the spawned processes through PMI
implementation specific 'info_keyval' parameters.

Errors:

* PMI_ERR_INVALID_ARG - invalid argument
* PMI_FAIL - spawn failed

Notes:

* This function is OPTIONAL in process managers that do not support
dynamic process management.
* The ``soft'' option is specified by mpiexec in the MPI-2 standard.

== Wire Protocol

The reference implementation of the PMI-1.1 wire protocol is the MPICH
Hydra[4] process manager.

The protocol is comprised of request and response messages.
All messages SHALL be terminated with a newline.
Messages SHALL consist of a series of key=value tuples, as defined below.

Only the client (process) SHALL send request messages.  Only the server
(process manager) SHALL send response messages.  The client and server
exchange request and response messages in lock-step.

The PMI-1.1 wire protocol is defined below in ABNF form.
For maximum interoperability, a message parser SHOULD allow

* key=value tuples to appear out of order within a message
* additional white space to appear between tuples
* additional keys to be present

=== Connection

If the wire protocol is offered, the process manager SHALL "pre-connect"
a file descriptor, arrange for the file descriptor to be inherited by
the process, and pass its number in the PMI_FD environment variable
at process launch time.

=== Version Negotiation

The client SHALL send the init request first, with the highest version
of PMI supported by the client.  The server SHALL respond with the
version of PMI that will be used for this connection.  The client SHALL NOT
send other commands until the init operation has completed.

=== Error Handling

All responses MAY include an "rc" key.
On error, the "rc" key SHALL be set to a nonzero value.
On success, the "rc" key MAY be set to zero, or it may be omitted.

Some responses MAY include a "msg" key.
On error, the "msg" key MAY be set to an error message.
On success, the "msg" key MAY be set to "success", or it may be omitted.

If a protocol error occurs, the detecting side SHALL immediately close
the connection and abort the program.  IT SHOULD log the message so that
the problem can be tracked down.

=== Spawn Operation

The spawn request consists of multiple newline-terminated messages.
These messages SHALL NOT be interspersed with messages for other operations.

The spawn operation passes zero or more arguments, zero or more "preput"
elements, and zero or more "info" elements.  The numbered indices of these
elements SHALL begin with zero and increase monotonically.

=== Back Compatibility

Earlier versions of the PMI-1 wire protocol did not include the init
operation in which versions are exchanged.  Protocol operations that
were culled in PMI 1.1 are not covered here.

=== Local Process Group Information

The process manager SHALL provide the local process group information
to programs via the KVS under the "PMI_process_mapping" key.
The value SHALL consist of a vector of "blocks", where a block is a
3-tuple of starting node id, number of nodes, and number of processes per
node, in the following format, expressed in ABNF:

----
PMI_process_mapping = "(vector," blocklist ")"

block               = "(" uint "," uint "," uint ")" ; 3-tuple: (nodeid,nnodes,ppn)
blocklist           = block *["," block]             ; comma delimited blocks

uint                = 1*DIGIT                        ; unsigned integer
----

Examples:

* '(vector,(0,16,16))' - 256 processes regularly mapped to 16 nodes,
16 processes per node.
* '(vector,(0,8,16),(8,4,32))' - 256 processes irregularly mapped to 12
nodes, 16 processes per node on the first eight nodes, 32 processes per
node on the last 4 nodes.

If the process mapping value is too long to fit in a KVS value, the process
manager SHALL return a value consisting of an empty string, indicating that
the mapping is unknown.
