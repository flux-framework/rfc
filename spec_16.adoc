The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

== Background

=== Components that use the KVS job schema

Instance components have direct, read/write access to the primary KVS
namespace:

* _Ingest agent_
* _Job management service_ (list, cancel, etc.)
* _Exec service_
* _Scheduler_

Guest components have direct, read/write access to a private KVS namespace:

* _Job shell_
* _User tasks_
* `flux-run` command
* `flux-queue` command
* `flux-cancel` command

=== Job Life Cycle

Jobs are submitted to the _ingest agent_ which performs a sanity
check on the request and either adds the job to the KVS or
refuses to accept it.

The _scheduler_ takes up submitted jobs and considers them against
the available resources.  It either rejects the job outright,
or annotates it and eventually assigns resources to it.

The _exec service_ takes up jobs that have assigned resources,
instantiates containers for those jobs and starts job shells
within them.  When job shells and their containers start to exit,
the _exec service_ "reaps" these shells and allows the _scheduler_
to reclaim resources assigned to each container.

Jobs therefore transition between the following states,
not necessarily in a linear order:

submitted::
  accepted by ingest, resources not yet assigned

runnable::
  resources assigned

starting::
  first container started

running::
  all containers instantiated and job shells started

exiting::
  first container exited

completed::
  all containers exited

rejected::
  scheduler won't run job

== Implementation

=== Primary KVS Namespace

The Flux instance has a default, shared namespace that is accessible
only by the instance owner.

All job data is stored under a `jobs` directory in the primary namespace.


=== Active vs Inactive Job Directories

Each active job has a directory under `jobs.active.<jobid>`,
where `<jobid>` is a unique sequence number assigned by the
_ingest agent_.

After a job is no longer active, its directory is moved from
`jobs.active` to `jobs.inactive`.  Inactive means its state
is read-only.  The purpose of moving inactive jobs to another
directory is to keep the size of the active directory manageable.
The `jobs.inactive` directory may need to be periodically archived
and purged to keep its size manageable in long-running instances.


=== Guest KVS Namespace

A guest-writable KVS namespace is created for the use of the
job shell and the application.  While the job is active,
this namespace is mounted in the primary namespace, on
`jobs.active.<jobid>.guest`.  While mounted, it can be changed
by the guest components without impacting performance of the primary
namespace, while still being accessible through the primary namespace.

Access to contents of the primary KVS namespace MAY be granted to
the guest by copying them to the guest KVS namespace.

When the job is inactive, the final snapshot of the guest namespace
is linked into the primary namespace, and the guest namespace is
destroyed.


=== Event Log

Active jobs undergo state transitions that are recorded under
the key `jobs.active.<jobid>.eventlog`.  A KVS append operation
is used to add events to this log.

Each append consists of a valid JSON event object, including
timestamp and format TBD.


=== Debug Log

`jobs.active.<jobid>.debuglog` is a similar log available for
capturing job-specific debug information from instance services.

Each append consists of a valid JSON event object, including
timestamp and format TBD.


=== Access to Primary Namespace by Guest Users

Site policy allowing limited access to job data by guest users
is implemented by the _job management_ service.

Examples are listing all active jobs with limited detail,
listing guest inactive/active jobs with full detail, and removing
jobs owned by the guest.


=== Content Produced by Ingest Agent

A user submits _J_ with attached signature.

The _ingest agent_ validates _J_ and if accepted, assigns the jobid
and creates `jobs.active.<jobid>.J-signed`.

The _ingest agent_ creates `jobs.active.<jobid>.eventlog`
and logs the initial state of "submitted".


=== Content Consumed/Produced by Scheduler

Upon discovery of a new `jobs.active.<jobid>` in the _submitted_ state,
the _scheduler_ reads `jobs.active.<jobid>.J-signed` and attempts to
match resources to the request.

The _scheduler_ may declare the job unrunnable, and move it to
`jobs.inactive`, logging a _rejected_ state transition to the event log.

The _scheduler_ may add annotations to the job (TBD) that are
of interest for job management, for example to indicate priority
or estimated wait time.  The scheduler may also add internal
annotations that are private to the scheduler, but convenient to
store in the KVS for recovery.  Annotations are stored as
keys under `jobs.active.<jobid>.scheduler`.

Upon resource allocation to the job, the _scheduler_ creates
`jobs.active.<jobid>.R`, copies this to `jobs.active.<jobid>.guest.R`,
and then logs a _runnable_ state transition to the event log.

The _scheduler_ may later revoke the allocation (TBD).


=== Content Consumed/Produced by Exec Service

Upon discovery of a new `jobs.active.<jobid>` in the _runnable_ state,
the the _exec service_ reads `jobs.active.<jobid>.J-signed`
and `jobs.active.<jobid>.R` and instantiates
containers for the allocated resources, starting the job
shell(s) and creating the guest namespace, mounting it on
`jobs.active.<jobid>.guest`.

Container creation(s) are logged to the event log (batched),
and the job state transitions of _starting_, and _running_
are appended to the event log.

Container destruction(s) are logged to the event log (batched),
and the job state transitions of _exiting_ and _completed_ are
are appended to the event log.


=== Content Produced/Consumed by Other Instance Services

Other services not mentioned in this RFC MAY store arbitrary data associated
with jobs under the `jobs.active.<jobid>.data.<service>` directory,
where `<service>` is a name unique to the service producing the data.
For example, a job tracing service may store persistent trace data under
the `jobs.active.<jobid>.data.trace` directory. 


=== Content Consumed/Produced by the Job Shell ===

The _job shell_, running as the guest, spawns tasks, handles
standard I/O, collects task exit codes, and provides PMI
service.

Any data produced by the _job shell_ is stored under the guest KVS
namespace `jobs.active.<jobid>.guest` and is preserved when the
task becomes inactive.

Any data consumed by the _job shell_ but not included in the guest KVS
namespace must be proxied through instance services such as the _exec
service_ or _job management service_ since the _job shell_ does not have
direct access to the primary KVS namespace.

Format of this data is TBD.
