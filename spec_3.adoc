3/CMB1 - Flux Comms Message Broker Protocol
===========================================

This specification describes the format of communications message broker
messages, Version 1, also referred to as CMB1.

CMB1 is encapsulated in the
http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:23/ZMTP[ZeroMQ Message Transfer Protocol (ZMTP)].

* State: draft

== Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

== Goals

The CMB1 protocol provides a way for Flux utilities and services to
communicate with one another within the context of a job.  CMB1 has
the following specific goals:

* Endpoint-count scalability (e.g. to 100K nodes) through multi-hop
  overlay networks.
* Overlay networks sharable by multiple Flux services and utilities.
* Provide request-response (RPC) communication idiom.
* Provide publish-subscribe communication idiom.
* Handle common failure cases such as hard-hung brokers or crashed nodes,
  but OK to propagate errors to services when necessary to keep running.
* Peer network transit latency of O(10^-3^sec) for small messages
* Protect messages with strong crypto:  privacy, integrity.
* Fast codec, minimizing heap memory allocations

== Background

`flux-broker` is a message broker daemon for the Flux resource manager
framework.  A _comms session_ is a set of interconnected `flux-broker` tasks
that together provide a shared communications substrate for distributed
resource manager services within a job .  Services and utilities communicate
by passing messages through the session brokers.  There are four
types of messages: events, requests, responses, and keepalives, which
share a common structure described herein.

Event messages are published such that they are available to subscribers
throughout the comms session.  Events are published with a _topic string_
attached.  Subscribers register a list of topic string prefixes
to filter the set of messages they receive.

Requests are messages addressed to a resource manager or broker service.
A topic string identifies the service and _method_.  A _nodeid_ optionally
identifies a particular `flux-broker` rank.  Requests follow the ZeroMQ
DEALER-ROUTER message flow, which builds a source-address route at each hop.

Responses are optional replies to requests.  They follow the ZeroMQ
ROUTER-DEALER message flow, which unwinds the source address route
accumulated by the request, and uses them to select among peers at each hop.

Keepalives are control messages used by one peer to indicate to another
peer that it is still alive when it is not otherwise communicating.

== Implementation

=== Rank Assignment

A _node_ is defined as a `flux-broker` task.  Each node in a comms
session of size N SHALL be assigned a rank in the range of 0 to N - 1.
Ranks SHALL be represented by a 32 bit unsigned integer, with the highest
value of (2^32^ - 3).

The rank FLUX_NODEID_ANY (2^32^ - 1) SHALL be reserved to indicate
_any rank_ in addressing.

The rank FLUX_NODEID_UPSTREAM (2^32^ - 2) SHALL be reserved to indicate
_any rank_ that is upstream of the sender in request addressing.
This value is reserved for the convenience of API implementations
and SHALL NOT appear in the nodeid slot of an encoded CMB1 message.

A node's rank SHALL be assigned at broker startup and SHALL NOT change
for the node's lifetime.

The size of the comms session SHALL be determined at startup and SHALL
not change for the life of the comms session. [Dynamic resize will
be covered in a future version of this specification.]

=== Overlay Networks

The nodes of a comms session SHALL at minimum be interconnected in
tree based overlay network with rank 0 at the root of the tree.
This overlay network SHALL use ZeroMQ DEALER-ROUTER sockets.

The nodes of a comms session MAY be interconnected in another overlay
topology to facilitate message delivery to specific ranks.  This overlay
network SHALL use ZeroMQ DEALER-ROUTER sockets.

The nodes of a comms session MAY be interconnected in another overlay
topology for event propagation.  This overlay network SHALL use ZeroMQ
PUB-SUB sockets.

=== Service Addressing

A Flux service SHALL be identified in a request by a _topic string_,
a set of words delimited by periods, in which the first word identifies
the service, and remaining words represent _methods_ within that service.
For example, "kvs.get" refers to the _get_ method of the _kvs_ service.

Built-in broker services SHALL begin with "cmb.".  Services implemented by
_comms modules_ (broker plugins)  SHALL begin with the name of the comms
module.

=== Default Request Routing

Request messages MAY be addressed to _any rank_ (FLUX_NODEID_ANY).
Such messages SHALL be routed to the local broker, then to the
first match in the following sequence:

. If topic string begins with "cmb." and the sender is not the same rank
  broker, the message SHALL be handled internally by the broker.
. If topic string begins with a word matching a local comms module
  and the sender is not the same comms module attached to the same rank
  broker, the message SHALL be routed to the comms module.
. If the broker is not the root node of the tree based overlay network,
  the message SHALL be routed to a parent node in the tree based overlay
  network, which SHALL re-apply this routing algorithm.

If the message is received by a comms module, but the remaining words of the
topic string do not match a method it implements, the comms module SHALL
respond with error number 38, "Function not implemented".

If the message reaches the root node, but none of the above conditions
are met, the root broker SHALL respond with error number 38,
"Function not implemented".

A service may send a request _upstream_ on the tree based overlay network
by placing the sending nodeid in the message and setting the
FLUX_MSGFLAG_UPSTREAM (16) flag.  Such a message SHALL handled
by the broker as if it were addressed to FLUX_NODEID_ANY, except
that the message SHALL NOT be delivered on the sending node.

=== Rank Request Routing

Request messages MAY be addressed to a specific rank.
Such messages SHALL be routed to the target broker rank, then to the
first match in the following sequence:

. If topic string begins with "cmb." and the sender is not the same rank
  broker, the message SHALL be handled internally by the broker
. If topic string begins with a word matching a local comms module,
  the message SHALL be routed to the comms module.

If the message is received by a comms module, but the remaining words of the
topic string do not match a method it implements, the comms module SHALL
respond with error number 38, "Function not implemented".

If the message reaches the target node, but none of the above conditions
are met, the broker SHALL respond with error number 38,
"Function not implemented".

If the message cannot be routed to the target node, the broker making
this determination SHALL respond with error number 113, "No route to host".

=== Event Routing

Event messages SHALL only be published by the rank 0 broker.  Other ranks MAY
cause an event to be sent by first forwarding it to rank 0.

=== General Message Format

CMB1 messages are multi-part ZeroMQ messages.

CMB1 messages MUST include a PROTO message part, positioned last for fast
access.  The PROTO part includes flags that indicate the presence of
additional message parts.

CMB1 messages MAY include a stack of message identity parts comprising
a source address route, positioned first for compatibility with ZeroMQ
DEALER-ROUTER sockets.  If message identity parts are present, a zero-size
route delimiter frame MUST be present and positioned next.

CMB1 messages MAY include a topic string part, positioned after route
delimiter, if any.  When the topic string part is first, it is compatible
with ZeroMQ PUB-SUB sockets.

Finally, CMB1 messages MAY include a payload part, positioned before
the PROTO part.  Payload parts SHALL use either raw encoding or JSON
encoding, as indicated by flags.  JSON payloads SHALL conform to
Internet RFC 7159, and the outermost JSON type SHALL be a JSON object, e.g.
beginning with the "{" character.

CMB1 messages are specified in detail by the following ABNF grammar.
