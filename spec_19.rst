19/Flux Locally Unique ID (FLUID)
=================================

This specification describes a scheme for a distributed, uncoordinated
*flux locally unique ID* service that generates 64 bit k-ordered, unique
identifiers that are a combination of timestamp since some epoch,
generator id, and sequence number. The scheme is used to generate
Flux job IDs.

Language
--------

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in `RFC 2119 <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119>`__.


Background
----------


Criteria
~~~~~~~~

*Very low probability of collision:* Like 128 bit UUIDs on a global scale,
FLUIDs should provide a reasonable guarantee against collisions on a
smaller scale: within a Flux instance.

*Distributed:* Flux job ingest should be distributed to achieve a high
job ingest rate, therefore the generation of ID’s should also be capable
of being distributed to promote scalability.

*Loosely ordered:* Job ID’s generated by legacy resource managers are
typically monotonically increasing integers that reflect job submission
order. This property is of debatable utility, but following the principle
of least astonishment, FLUIDs should retain it if possible.


Existing Solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The design of FLUIDs is patterned after
`Twitter Snowflake <https://blog.twitter.com/2010/announcing-snowflake>`__, and
the derived implementation `Boundary Flake <https://github.com/boundary/flake>`__.
The basic scheme is to couple a timestamp, machine or generator id, and
sequence number into a number of bits.

Placing the timestamp into the most significant bits of the ID allows
independently generated IDs to be loosely sorted (k-ordered). Use of a
separate machine ID per generator ensures uniqueness without coordination,
and the sequence number ensures each generator can create a certain number
of IDs per timestamp unit.


Implementation
--------------

FLUIDs are composed of ``[ timestamp | id | sequence ]`` similar to Snowflake,
to allow distributed, uncoordinated ID generation across a Flux instance,
with the allocation of bits customized for the unique use case in Flux:

-  40 bits for timestamp since epoch in milliseconds, good for a 35 year
   long runtime with custom epoch set to job start time.

-  14 bits for generator ID (up to 16K generators). By default, the generator
   ID could be set to the rank. For sessions greater than 16K ranks, some
   generators could be idled and forward requests up the tree to keep the max
   generators to 16K.

-  10 bits for sequence number (1024 IDs per ms)

With this scheme it is theoretically possible to create a max of about 16B
FLUIDs per second for 34 years.

This type of generator *guarantees* unique IDs, with probability of collision
equal to zero, so no collision detection is required.


Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A FLUID is a 64-bit integer, e.g. ``6731191091817518``.

Representations other than decimal MAY be used where appropriate,
for instance for compactness or ease of transcription over the phone.

The following sections describe the set of supported alternate
representations for FLUIDs.


FLUID base58 (F58) Encoding
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to create a compact, human readable representation
of a FLUID, the main alternate encoding of a FLUID SHALL be `Base58
<https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Base58>`__, using the alphabet

 ``123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz``

To disambiguate this Base58 representation from decimal or other
representations, FLUIDs with this encoding SHALL be prefixed with the
Unicode character U+0192 ``ƒ``, and the final result SHALL be termed
"FLUID base58 Encoding" or F58 for short. For example, the FLUID
``6731191091817518`` from above SHALL be represented in F58 as
``ƒuZZybuNNy``. As a fallback mechanism, a FLUID prefixed with an
ASCII lowercase f ``f`` will also be decoded as F58.

Examples: ``ƒZemgA8Bzf``, ``ƒ278oEf7zGf``

FLUID Hexadecimal (hex) Encoding
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A hexadecimal encoding SHALL represent a FLUID in base16, including
a ``0x`` prefix to unambiguously differentiate the representation from
other FLUID standard encodings.

Examples: ``0x17e9fb8df16c2e``, ``0xedaf97d000000``


FLUID Dotted-Hexadecimal (dothex) Encoding
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to support indexing of FLUIDs in a hierarchical KVS namespace,
a dotted-hexadecimal encoding SHALL represent a FLUID in base16,
with each 4 hexadecimal digits separated by dots (``.``).

Examples: ``0017.e9fb.8df1.6c2e``, ``000e.daf9.7d00.0000``


FLUID Mnemonic (words) Encoding
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to ease transferring of FLUIDs via human interaction, a
mnemonic representation of FLUIDS SHALL be supported by a conformant
implementation.

The `mnemonicode <https://github.com/singpolyma/mnemonicode>`__
implementation converts integers to strings of pronounceable words and
back again. This encoding MAY be used when a FLUID must be conveyed
by speaking, e.g. over the phone.

Examples: ``reform-remote-galileo--heart-package-academy``, ``random-idea-yoyo--sugar-printer-academy``


Decoding Alternate FLUID Representations
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The standard FLUID representations described in this RFC are
unambiguous by design. That is, the type of FLUID encoding can
be definitively determined by the string representation.

Implementations that take an encoded FLUID as a string argument
SHALL use the following rules to decode the argument:

 * If a string contains ``.``, then decode as "dothex"
 * Else if the string contains ``-``, then decode as "words"
 * Else if the string starts with ``ƒ`` or ``f``, decode as F58
 * Else if the string starts with ``0x`` decode as "hex"
 * Otherwise, decode as decimal

An implementation decoding FLUID string representations SHALL
ignore leading and trailing whitespace.
