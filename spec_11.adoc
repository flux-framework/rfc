11/Key Value Store Tree Object Format v1
========================================

The Flux Key Value Store (KVS) implements hierarchical key namespaces
layered atop the content storage service described in RFC 10.
Namespaces are organized as hash trees of content-addressed _tree objects_
and values.  This specification defines the version 1 format of key value
store tree objects.

* Name: github.com/flux-framework/rfc/spec_11.adoc
* Editor: Jim Garlick <garlick@llnl.gov>
* State: raw

== Language

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD",
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to
be interpreted as described in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

== Goals

* Facilitate services implementing private KVS namespaces.
* Users may directly walk a KVS namespace, starting with a blobref/treeref.
* Tree objects can be exchanged between Flux instances.
* Tree objects can be parsed years after they were written (provenance).
* Values exceeding the blob size limit (RFC 10) can be represented.
* Tree objects exceeding the blob size limit (RFC 10) can be represented.
* Values support an append operation.
* A KVS namespace of arbitrary depth can be "rolled up" into one tree object.
* Tree objects are (somewhat) self-describing.

== Implementation

All tree objects SHALL be represented as JSON objects containing three top
level names:

* _ver_, an integer version number
* _type_, a string type name
* _val_, a type dependent JSON object

There are five types: 

* _valref_, val is an array of blobrefs comprising opaque data
* _treeref_, val is an array of blobrefs comprising a tree object
* _dir_, val is a map of names to tree objects
* _symlink_, val is a hierarchical key name
* _value_, val is an arbitrary JSON object, array, or value
